Title: Place Multiple Orders (Batching) - Polymarket Documentation

URL Source: https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/orders/create-order-batch

Markdown Content:
Polymarket’s CLOB supports batch orders, allowing you to place up to `15` orders in a single request. Before using this feature, make sure you’re comfortable placing a single order first. You can find the documentation for that [here.](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/orders/create-order)**HTTP REQUEST**`POST /<clob-endpoint>/orders`

### Request Payload Parameters

| orderType | yes | string | order type (“FOK”, “GTC”, “GTD”, “FAK”) |
| owner | yes | string | api key of order owner |
| postOnly | no | boolean | if `true`, the order will only rest on the book and not match immediately (default: `false`) |

An `order` object is the form:

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| salt | yes | integer | random salt used to create unique order |
| maker | yes | string | maker address (funder) |

| tokenId | yes | string | ERC1155 token ID of conditional token being traded |

| feeRateBps | yes | string | fee rate basis points as required by the operator |
| side | yes | string | buy or sell enum index |
| signatureType | yes | integer | signature type enum index |
| signature | yes | string | hex encoded signature |

### Order types

*   **FOK**: A Fill-Or-Kill order is an market order to buy (in dollars) or sell (in shares) shares that must be executed immediately in its entirety; otherwise, the entire order will be cancelled.
*   **FAK**: A Fill-And-Kill order is a market order to buy (in dollars) or sell (in shares) that will be executed immediately for as many shares as are available; any portion not filled at once is cancelled.
*   **GTC**: A Good-Til-Cancelled order is a limit order that is active until it is fulfilled or cancelled.
*   **GTD**: A Good-Til-Date order is a type of order that is active until its specified date (UTC seconds timestamp), unless it has already been fulfilled or cancelled. There is a security threshold of one minute. If the order needs to expire in 90 seconds the correct expiration value is: now + 1 minute + 30 seconds

### Response Format

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| success | boolean | boolean indicating if server-side err (`success = false`) -> server-side error |
| errorMsg | string | error message in case of unsuccessful placement (in case `success = false`, e.g. `client-side error`, the reason is in `errorMsg`) |
| orderId | string | id of order |
| orderHashes | string[] | hash of settlement transaction order was marketable and triggered a match |

### Insert Error Messages

If the `errorMsg` field of the response object from placement is not an empty string, the order was not able to be immediately placed. This might be because of a delay or because of a failure. If the `success` is not `true`, then there was an issue placing the order. The following `errorMessages` are possible:
